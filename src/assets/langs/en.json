    "title": "About me",
    "description": "I’m a front-end developer with over 4 years of experience, mainly working with Vue.js, React, and frameworks like Bootstrap, Material UI, and Element Plus. I spent 3 years at Facilita, where I helped build and maintain web systems using Laravel and Blade. Currently, I work at Cilia, developing modern interfaces and reusable components with Vue.js. I have a growing interest in back-end development, especially with Node.js and Laravel, aiming to become a full-stack developer. I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from UniFanap, a postgraduate degree in Project Management, and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Instituto DNC to further enhance my technical skills."
